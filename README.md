# Image Processing

### Overview
In this small, self-guided project I explore my curiosity for the "newly" developing and growing domain of image analytics. I employ the use of open-source examples and learn how to perform fundamental image processing techniques on a variety of existing images as well on live video. 

Examples of some image processing techniques I explore here as follows:
- Blurring & Smoothing
- Morphological TransformationsÂ¶
- Edge Detection and Gradients
- Object Detection Using Haar Cascades
...and many others

Within each technique, I offer my understanding of the processing technique along with other reference points that will help my futureself, along with anybody else reading, to get better aquanted with the same. 

Thank you for reading!
